code project description
Color detection is the process of identifying any color in an image. Color detection is essential for the recognition of objects, and it is also included in many drawing and image editing applications. Most of us canâ€™t differentiate between or even remember the names of colors since there can be up to 16 million colors based on RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values. Therefore, Color Detection is an excellent data analytics project for students, as they will be able to build an interactive application that will accurately identify the color in an image. .
